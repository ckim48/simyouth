  "title": "Ethics in Humanitarian Coordination during the Korean War",
  "intro": "The Korean War (1950-1953) was a significant conflict that arose from the division of Korea into North and South after World War II. As tensions escalated, military actions led to widespread devastation and a humanitarian crisis, with millions of civilians affected. Humanitarian coordinators played a crucial role in providing aid and ensuring the protection of civilians amidst the chaos of war. This scenario presents a series of ethical decisions that a humanitarian coordinator might face while navigating the complexities of delivering aid in a conflict zone, emphasizing the importance of adhering to International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the principles of neutrality, impartiality, and humanity.",
